      "\n",
      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "This paper proposes a mixed-integer conic programming formulation for the minimum loss distribution network reconfiguration problem. This formulation has two features: first, it employs a convex representation of the network model which is based on the conic quadratic format of the power flow equations and second, it optimizes the exact value of the network losses. The use of a convex model in terms of the continuous variables is particularly important because it ensures that an optimal solution obtained by a branch-and-cut algorithm for mixed-integer conic programming is global. In addition, good quality solutions with a relaxed optimality gap can be very efficiently obtained. A polyhedral approximation which is amenable to solution via more widely available mixed-integer linear programming software is also presented. Numerical results on practical test networks including distributed generation show that mixed-integer convex optimization is an effective tool for network reconfiguration. © 2012 IEEE.\n",

      "Drivers of international variation in prevalence of disabling low back pain: Findings from the Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability study\n",
      "\n",
      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "Background: Wide international variation in the prevalence of disabling low back pain (LBP) among working populations is not explained by known risk factors. It would be useful to know whether the drivers of this variation are specific to the spine or factors that predispose to musculoskeletal pain more generally. Methods: Baseline information about musculoskeletal pain and risk factors was elicited from 11 710 participants aged 20–59 years, who were sampled from 45 occupational groups in 18 countries. Wider propensity to pain was characterized by the number of anatomical sites outside the low back that had been painful in the 12 months before baseline (‘pain propensity index’). After a mean interval of 14 months, 9055 participants (77.3%) provided follow-up data on disabling LBP in the past month. Baseline risk factors for disabling LBP at follow-up were assessed by random intercept Poisson regression. Results: After allowance for other known and suspected risk factors, pain propensity showed the strongest association with disabling LBP (prevalence rate ratios up to 2.6, 95% CI: 2.2–3.1; population attributable fraction 39.8%). Across the 45 occupational groups, the prevalence of disabling LBP varied sevenfold (much more than within-country differences between nurses and office workers), and correlated with mean pain propensity index (r = 0.58). Conclusions: Within our study, major international variation in the prevalence of disabling LBP appeared to be driven largely by factors predisposing to musculoskeletal pain at multiple anatomical sites rather than by risk factors specific to the spine. Significance: Our findings indicate that differences in general propensity to musculoskeletal pain are a major driver of large international variation in the prevalence of disabling low back pain among people of working age. © 2018 The Authors.

      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "This article begins with the premise that market-oriented development strategies require more than the free movement of the factors of production from one use to another; they also require a positive work ethic and an energetic and committed workforce. However, the existing Arab work ethic does not seem conducive to development and change. This article assesses some antecedents that might have led to the emergence of the existing work ethic. First, we address the potential role of religion in developing a value system that is not conducive to growth and development. We also tackle family dynamics in the Arab world and the impact of family structures on personal and group development. Then, we move our attention to the educational system in the Arab world trying to uncover any common patterns in the various educational approaches in the Arab world that could have had lasting impressions on power dynamics in Arab societies. We also address power and leadership relationships and focus our attention on how groups actually function in the Arab world. Thereafter, we tackle what has emerged out of these societal institutions and relationships, and offer some implications marking out paths for international managers. © Springer 2009.\n",

      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "Lung cancer development relies on cell proliferation and migration, which in turn requires interaction with extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The mechanisms through which GAGs regulate cancer cell functions are not fully understood but they are, in part, mediated by controlled interactions with cytokines and growth factors (GFs). In order to mechanistically understand the effect of the degree of sulfation (DS) of GAGs on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, we synthesized sulfated alginate (AlgSulf) as sulfated GAG mimics with DS = 0.0, 0.8, 2.0, and 2.7. Human (H1792) and mouse (MDA-F471) LUAD cell lines were treated with AlgSulf of various DSs at two concentrations 10 and 100 μg/mL and their anti-tumor properties were assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), trypan blue exclusion, and wound healing assays for 2D models and sphere formation assay for the 3D model. The proliferation and number of live MDA-F471 cells at the concentration of 100 μg/mL decreased significantly with the increase in the DS of biomimetic GAGs. In addition, the increase in the DS of biomimetic GAGs decreased cell migration (p < 0.001 for DS = 2.0 and 2.7 compared to control) and decreased the diameter and number of spheres formed (p < 0.001). The increased DS of biomimetic GAGs attenuated the expression of cancer stem cell (CSC)/progenitor markers in the 3D cultures. In conclusion, GAG-mimetic AlgSulf with increased DS exhibit enhanced anti-proliferative and migratory properties while also reducing growth of KRAS-mutant LUAD spheres in vitro. We suggest that these anti-tumor effects by GAG-mimetic AlgSulf are possibly due to differential binding to GFs and consequential decreased cell stemness. AlgSulf may be suitable for applications in cancer therapy after further in vivo validation. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\n",

      "Network security is a key challenge for the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT). New attacks have been developed to exploit the vulnerabilities of IoT devices. Moreover, IoT immense scale will amplify traditional network attacks. Machine learning has been extensively applied for traffic classification and intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose a framework, specifically for IoT devices identification and malicious traffic detection. Pushing the intelligence to the network edge, this framework extracts features per network flow to identify the source, the type of the generated traffic, and to detect network attacks. Different machine learning algorithms are compared with random forest, which gives the best results: Up to 94.5% accuracy for device-type identification, up to 93.5% accuracy for traffic-type classification, and up to 97% accuracy for abnormal traffic detection. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19 and is spread person-to-person through close contact. We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020177047. Findings: Our search identified 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 to 0·38; risk difference [RD] −10·2%, 95% CI −11·5 to −7·5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; p<inf>interaction</inf>=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 to −10·7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; p<inf>interaction</inf>=0·090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD −10·6%, 95% CI −12·5 to −7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings. Interpretation: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance.

      "Diagnostic classification of irritability and oppositionality in youth: a global field study comparing ICD-11 with ICD-10 and DSM-5\n",
      "\n",
      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "Background: Severe irritability has become an important topic in child and adolescent mental health. Based on the available evidence and on public health considerations, WHO classified chronic irritability within oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in ICD-11, a solution markedly different from DSM-5’s (i.e. the new childhood mood diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [DMDD]) and from ICD-10’s (i.e. ODD as one of several conduct disorders without attention to irritability). In this study, we tested the accuracy with which a global, multilingual, multidisciplinary sample of clinicians were able to use the ICD-11 classification of chronic irritability and oppositionality as compared to the ICD-10 and DSM-5 approaches. Methods: Clinicians (N = 196) from 48 countries participated in an Internet-based field study in English, Spanish, or Japanese and were randomized to review and use one of the three diagnostic systems. Through experimental manipulation of validated clinical vignettes, we evaluated how well clinicians in each condition could identify chronic irritability versus nonirritable oppositionality, episodic bipolar disorder, dysthymic depression, and normative irritability. Results: Compared to ICD-10 and DSM-5, ICD-11 led to more accurate identification of severe irritability and better differentiation from boundary presentations. Participants using DSM-5 largely failed to apply the DMDD diagnosis when it was appropriate, and they more often applied psychopathological diagnoses to developmentally normative irritability. Conclusions: The formulation of irritability and oppositionality put forth in ICD-11 shows evidence of clinical utility, supporting accurate diagnosis. Global mental health clinicians can readily identify ODD both with and without chronic irritability. © 2020 The World Health Organization\n",

      "\n",
      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "In this study, the synthesis and characterization of the fluorescent metal–organic framework (MOF)-polymer composites is reported based on zirconium-based MOFs (UiO-66 and UiO-66(OH)₂) and a conjugated polyelectrolyte, poly(phenylene ethynylene) carboxylate (PPE-CO₂-108). The defect-rich nature of these Zr-MOFs facilitates strong interactions between the polyelectrolyte's carboxylic acid moieties and the open metal sites on the Zr clusters within the MOF nanoparticles. The composites are prepared by a simple impregnation approach, where MOF nanocrystals suspended in HEPES buffer are added to the polymeric solution under sonication for 10 min. The obtained MOF composites (i.e., UiO-66-CPE and UiO-66 (OH)<inf>2</inf>-CPE) are characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, zeta potential measurements, and UV–vis spectroscopy. The characterization confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the MOF nanocrystals on the polymer as seen in the SEM images, and the interaction with PPE-CO₂-108 is confirmed by the decrease in the surface areas from 1050 to 590 m2 g−1 for UiO-66-CPE and from 500 to 137 m2 g−1, for UiO-66(OH)<inf>2</inf>-CPE. Fluorescence microscopy revealed strong fluorescence in the microparticles, confirming robust polymer-MOF interaction. The composites also exhibit improved photostability of the conjugated polyelectrolyte, suggesting their potential for applications in biomedical imaging and other areas requiring stable and bright fluorescent systems. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.\n",

      "📝 ABSTRACT:\n",
      "Iron deficiency, even in the absence of anemia, can be debilitating, and exacerbate any underlying chronic disease, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Iron deficiency is frequently concomitant with chronic inflammatory disease; however, iron deficiency treatment is often overlooked, partially due to the heterogeneity among clinical practice guidelines. In the absence of consistent guidance across chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease, we provide practical recommendations for iron deficiency to treating physicians: definition, diagnosis, and disease-specific diagnostic algorithms. These recommendations should facilitate appropriate diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes. © 2017 The Authors American Journal of Hematology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",
